      <p>
        I drink the Orange Julius Protein Smoothie every morning before my workout.  You can add energy powder as well, although I do not.  This smoothie is a copycat recipe for the Dairy Queen Orange Julius Smoothie, but the healthy version of course! The Orange Julius Protein Smoothie provides me with the adequate amount of protein to start my day!
