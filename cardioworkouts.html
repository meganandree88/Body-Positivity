        I am a Division III softball player for Franklin & Marshall College who has been lifting, running, and working out since I was 12 years old.  I am provided with weekly college workouts from F&M's softball speed and strength coach.  The weekly workouts are a combination of HITT , cardio, and lifting workouts. I have altered these workouts to physically challenge my body while combining cardio and muscle strengthening into various workouts.  These workouts burn fat while building lean muscle.

These workouts were created by my softball trainer Scott Evans to tone abs, arms, and legs while increasing heart rate for maximum calorie burn. I recommend the 'Got to Love it' workout. </h3>
